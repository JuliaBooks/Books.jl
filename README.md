## Usage

To install this package (Julia â‰¥1.6), use
```
pkg> add Books
```

See, the [documentation](https://rikhuijzer.github.io/Books.jl) for more information.

### Windows

Currently, Windows is not supported.
Some regexes expects paths to contain a forward slash and things like that.
I don't plan to invest time in supporting Windows, but PRs for Windows will be reviewed and merged.
