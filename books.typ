= About
<sec:about>
Similar to #link("https://bookdown.org")[Bookdown];, this package wraps
around #link("https://pandoc.org/")[Pandoc];. For websites, this package
allows for:

- Building a website spanning multiple pages.
- Live reloading the website to see changes quickly; thanks to Pandoc
  and #link("https://github.com/tlienart/LiveServer.jl")[LiveServer.jl];.
- Cross-references from one web page to a section on another page.
- Embedding dynamic output, while still allowing normal Julia package
  utilities, such as unit testing and live reloading (Revise.jl).
- Showing code blocks as well as output.
- Interacting with code from within the REPL.

If you don’t need to generate PDFs, then
#link("https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl")[Franklin.jl] is
probably a better choice. To create single pages and PDFs containing
code blocks, see #link("https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl")[Weave.jl];.

One of the main differences with Franklin.jl, Weave.jl and knitr
(Bookdown) is that this package completely decouples the computations
from the building of the output. The benefit of this is that you can
spawn two separate processes, namely the one to serve your webpages:

```language-julia
$ julia --project -e 'using Books; serve()'
Watching ./pandoc/favicon.png
Watching ./src/plots.jl
[...]
 ✓ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8001/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

and the one where you do the computations for your package:

```
$ julia --project -ie 'using Books'

julia> gen()
[...]
Updating html
```

This way, the website remains responsive when the computations are
running. Thanks to LiveServer.jl and Pandoc, updating the page after
changing text or code takes less than a second. Also, because the
`serve` process does relatively few things, it almost never crashes.

As another benefit, the decoupling allows you to have more flexibility
in when you want to run what code. In combination with Revise.jl, you
can quickly update your code and see the updated output.

Another reason why this package looks different than other packages is
because this package has been aimed at a REPL workflow. Via the REPL,
the package evaluates the code blocks inside `Main` by default. This
provides easy access to the variables.

Finally, a big difference with this package and other packages is that
you decide yourself what you want to show for a code block. For example,
in R

````
```{r, results='hide'}
print("Hello, world!")
```
````

shows the code and not the output. Instead, in Books, you would write

````
```jl
s = """print("Hello, world!")"""
sc(s)
```
````

which is displayed as

```language-julia
print("Hello, world!")
```

Here, `sc` is one of the convenience methods exported by Books.jl.
Although this approach is more verbose in some cases, it is also much
more flexible. In essence, you can come up with your own pre- or
post-processing logic. For example, lets write

````
```jl
code = """
    df = DataFrame(a=[1, 2], b=[3, 4])
    Options(df, caption="A table.", label=nothing)
    """
repeat(sco(code), 4)
```
````

which shows the code and output (`sco`) 4 times:

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(a=[1, 2], b=[3, 4])
Options(df, caption="A table.", label=nothing)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([a], [b],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [3],
    [2], [4],
  )]
  , caption: [A table.]
  , kind: table
  )

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(a=[1, 2], b=[3, 4])
Options(df, caption="A table.", label=nothing)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([a], [b],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [3],
    [2], [4],
  )]
  , caption: [A table.]
  , kind: table
  )

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(a=[1, 2], b=[3, 4])
Options(df, caption="A table.", label=nothing)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([a], [b],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [3],
    [2], [4],
  )]
  , caption: [A table.]
  , kind: table
  )

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(a=[1, 2], b=[3, 4])
Options(df, caption="A table.", label=nothing)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([a], [b],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [3],
    [2], [4],
  )]
  , caption: [A table.]
  , kind: table
  )

= Getting started
<sec:getting-started>
The easiest way to get started is to use the template repository at
#link("https://github.com/JuliaBooks/BookTemplate");.

From this repository, you can serve your book via:

```language-julia
$ julia --project -e 'using Books; serve()'
Watching ./pandoc/favicon.png
Watching ./src/plots.jl
[...]
 ✓ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8001/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

To generate all the Julia output (see
Section~#link(<sec:embedding-output>)[3.1] for more information) use

```
$ julia --project -ie  'using Books; using MyPackage'

julia> gen(; )
[...]
Updating html
```

where `MyPackage` is the name of your package. This evaluates all the
code from the code blocks inside your `Main` module. The benefit of this
is that you can easy interact with and access variables defined inside
code blocks.

To avoid code duplication between projects, this package tries to have
good defaults for many settings. For your project, you can override the
default settings by creating `config.toml` and `metadata.yml` files. In
summary, the `metadata.yml` file is read by Pandoc while generating the
outputs. This file contains settings for the output appearance, author
and more, see Section~#link(<sec:metadata>)[2.1];. The `config.toml`
file is read by Books.jl before calling Pandoc, so contains settings
which are essentially passed to Pandoc, see
Section~#link(<sec:config>)[2.2];. Still, these defaults can be
overwritten. If you also want to override the templates, then see
Section~#link(<sec:templates>)[2.3];.

To generate the PDF, use

```
julia> pdf()
```

== metadata.yml
<sec:metadata>
The `metadata.yml` file is read by Pandoc. Settings in this file affect
the behaviour of Pandoc and get inserted in the templates. For more info
on templates, see Section~#link(<sec:templates>)[2.3];. You can override
settings by placing a `metadata.yml` file at the root directory of your
project. For example, the metadata for this project contains:

```output
---
title: Books.jl
subtitle: Create books with Julia
author:
  - Rik Huijzer
  - and contributors

# An example additional header include for html.
# Note that the url will be updated by \`Books.fix_links\`.
header-includes:
- |
  \`\`\`{=html}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/files/style.css"/>
  \`\`\`
mousetrap: true

#
# PDF only settings.
#
pdf-footer: ""

# For example, to add extra packages.
extra-pdf-header: |
  \usepackage{cancel}

# Avoid adding a blank page before each chapter.
disable-cleardoublepage: true

bibliography: bibliography.bib

titlepage-top: ""

titlepage-bottom: |
  \`\`\`{=typst}
  #link("https://huijzer.xyz/Books.jl/")
  \`\`\`
---
```

And, the following defaults are set by Books.jl.

```output
---
title: My book
subtitle: My book subtitle
author:
  - John Doe

# Licenses; can be empty.

```

Note that Pandoc has a great templating system. In the template
`default/template.typ` of this project, I tried to get the basics right
and haven’t spend hours on making it configurable. However, if you want
to add options to the templates, feel free to open a pull request. If
you want to configure the template completely by yourself, you can place
"template.typ" in "pandoc/" at the root of your project. This same holds
for the HTML and CSS template.

== config.toml
<sec:config>
The `config.toml` file is used by Books.jl. Settings in this file affect
how Pandoc is called. In `config.toml`, you can define multiple
projects; at least define `projects.default`. The settings of
`projects.default` are used when you call `pdf()` or `serve()`. To use
other settings, for example the settings for `dev`, use
`pdf(project="dev")` or `serve(project="dev")`.

Below, the default configuration is shown. When not defining a
`config.toml` file or omitting any of the settings, such as `port`,
these defaults will be used. You don’t have to copy all these defaults,
only #emph[override] the settings that you want to change. The benefit
of multiple projects is, for example, that you can run a `dev` project
locally which contains more information than the `default` project. One
example could be where you write a paper, book or report and have a page
with some notes.

The meaning of `contents` is discussed in
Section~#link(<sec:about_contents>)[2.2.1];. The `pdf_filename` is used
by `pdf()` and the `port` setting is used by `serve()`. For this
documentation, the following config is used

```output
[projects]

  [projects.default]
  contents = [
    "about",
    "getting-started",
    "demo",
    "references",
  ]
  output_filename = "books"

  # Full URL, required for the sitemap and robots.txt.
  online_url = "https://huijzer.xyz"
  online_url_prefix = ""

  # Extra directories to be copied.
  extra_directories = [
    "images",
    "files"
  ]

  port = 8012

  [projects.notes]
  contents = [
    "demo",
    "notes",
    "references"
  ]

  # This project is only used when testing Books.jl.
  [projects.test]
  contents = [
    "test"
  ]

  online_url = "https://example.com"
  online_url_prefix = "/Example.jl"

```

Which overrides some settings from the following default settings

```output
[projects]

  # Default project, used when calling serve() or pdf().
  [projects.default]
  homepage_contents = "index"

  metadata_path = "metadata.yml"

  contents = [
    "introduction",
    "analysis",
    "references"
  ]

  # Output filename for the PDF.
  output_filename = "analysis"

  # Full URL, required for the sitemap.
  online_url = "https://example.com"

  # Prefix for GitHub or GitLab Pages.
  online_url_prefix = ""

  # Port used by serve().
  port = 8010

  # Extra directories to be copied from the project root into `_build/`.
  extra_directories = []

  # For large books, it can be nice to show some information on the homepage
  # which is only visible to online visitors and hidden from offline users (PDF).
  include_homepage_outside_html = false

  # Syntax highlighting.
  highlight = true

  # Alternative project, used when calling, for example, serve(project="dev").
  [projects.dev]
  homepage_contents = "index"

  metadata_path = "metadata.yml"

  contents = [
    "introduction",
    "analysis",
    "notes",
    "references"
  ]

  output_filename = "analysis-with-notes"

  port = 8011

  extra_directories = []

  include_homepage_outside_html = false
```

Here, the `extra_directories` allows you to specify directories which
need to be moved into `_build`, which makes them available for the local
server and online. This is, for instance, useful for images like
Figure~#link(<fig:store>)[1];:

```
![Book store.](images/book-store.jpg){#fig:book_store}
```

shows as

#figure(image("images/book-store.jpg"),
  caption: [
    Figure 1: Book store.
  ]
)
<fig:store>

=== About contents
<sec:about_contents>
The files listed in `contents` are read from the `contents/` directory
and passed to Pandoc in the order specified by this list. It doesn’t
matter whether the files contain headings or at what levels the heading
are. Pandoc will just place the texts behind each other.

This list doesn’t mention the homepage for the website. That one is
specified on a per project basis with `homepage_contents`, which
defaults to `index`. The homepage typically contains the link to the
generated PDF. Note that the homepage is only added to the html output
and not to pdf or other outputs.

=== Website landing page
<website-landing-page>
By default, Books.jl assumes that you will want a separate landing page
for your book when you host it. This page is not added to the generated
outputs, like PDF, so it’s a nice place to put links to the generated
outputs. You will need to create a `index.md` file in the `contents`
directory. Then, using an top-level header from Markdown (e.g.~"\#
Title"), give the file a title. Immediately after the title, you need to
write `{-}` to avoid this chapter showing up in your HTML menu.

Here is an example of how an example `index.md` file looks like:

```mkd
# My Book's Awesome Title! {-}

Welcome to the landing page for my awesome book!
```

== Templates
<sec:templates>
Unlike `metadata.yml` and `config.toml`, the default templates should be
good for most users. To override these, create one or more of the files
listed in Table~#link(<tbl:templates>)[1];.

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (auto,auto,auto,),
    table.header([File], [Description], [Affects],),
    table.hline(),
    [`pandoc/style.csl`], [citation style], [all outputs],
    [`pandoc/style.css`], [style sheet], [website],
    [`pandoc/template.html`], [HTML template], [website],
    [`pandoc/template.tex`], [PDF template], [PDF],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 1: Default templates.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:templates>
Here, the citation style defaults to APA, because it is the only style
that I could find that correctly supports parenthetical and in-text
citations. For example,

- in-text: #cite(<orwell1945animal>, form: "prose")
- parenthetical: @orwell1945animal

For other citation styles from the
#link("https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles")[citation-style-language];,
users have to manually specify the author in the in-text citations.

= Demo
<sec:demo>
We can refer to a section with the normal
#link("https://lierdakil.github.io/pandoc-crossref/")[pandoc-crossref]
syntax. For example,

```language-markdown
See @sec:getting-started.
```

See Section~#link(<sec:getting-started>)[2];.

```language-plain
We can refer to citations such as @orwell1945animal and
[@orwell1949nineteen] or to equations such as @eq:example.
```

We can refer to citations such as
#cite(<orwell1945animal>, form: "prose") and @orwell1949nineteen or to
equations such as Equation~#link(<eq:example>)[1];.

```language-tex
$$ y = \frac{\sin{x}}{\cos{x}} $$ {#eq:example}
```

$ y = frac(sin x, cos x) #h(2em) (1) $<eq:example>

```language-plain
Use single dollar symbols for inline math: $x = 3$.
```

Use single dollar symbols for inline math: $x = 3$.

== Embedding output
<sec:embedding-output>
For embedding code, you can use the `jl` inline code or code block. For
example, to show the Julia version, define a code block like

````
```jl
YourModule.julia_version()
```
````

in a Markdown file. Then, in your package, define the method
`julia_version()`:

```
julia_version() = "This book is built with Julia $VERSION."
```

Next, call `using Books, MyPackage` and `gen()` to run all the defined
in the Markdown files. If you prefer to be less explicit, you can call
`gen(; M=YourModule)` to allow for:

````
```jl
julia_version()
```
````

instead of `YourModule.julia_version()`. When passing your module `M` as
keyword argument, `Books.jl` will evaluate all code blocks inside that
module.

Alternatively, if you work on a large project and want to only generate
the output for one or more Markdown files in `contents/`, such as
`index.md`, use

```language-julia
gen("index")
```

Calling `gen` will place the text

```output
This book is built with Julia 1.11.5.
```

at the right path so that it can be included by Pandoc. You can also
embed output inline with single backticks like

```
`jl YourModule.julia_version()`
```

or just call Julia’s constant `VERSION` directly from within the
Markdown file. For example,

```language-markdown
This book is built with Julia `jl VERSION`.
```

This book is built with Julia 1.11.5.

While doing this, it is expected that you also have the browser open and
a server running, see Section~#link(<sec:getting-started>)[2];. That
way, the page is immediately updated when you run `gen`.

Note that it doesn’t matter where you define the function
`julia_version`, as long as it is in your module. To save yourself some
typing, and to allow yourself to get some coffee while Julia gets up to
speed, you can start Julia for your package with

```
$ julia --project -ie 'using MyPackage'
```

which allows you to re-generate all the content by calling

```
julia> gen()
```

To run this method automatically when you make a change in your package,
ensure that you loaded
#link("https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl")[`Revise.jl`] before
loading your package and run

```language-julia
entr(gen, ["contents"], [MyPackage])
```

Which will automatically run `gen()` whenever one of the files in
`contents/` changes or any code in the `MyPackage` module. To only run
`gen` for one file, such as `contents/my_text.md`, use:

```language-julia
entr(() -> gen("my_text"), ["contents"], [MyPackage])
```

Or, the equivalent helper function exported by `Books.jl`:

```language-julia
entr_gen("my_text"; M=[MyPackage])
```

With this, `gen("my_text")` will be called every time something changes
in one of the files in the contents folder or when something changes in
`YourModule`. Note that you can run this while `serve` is running in
another terminal in the background. Then, your Julia code is executed
and the website is automatically updated every time you change something
in `content` or `MyPackage`. Also note that `gen` is a drop-in
replacement for `entr_gen`, so you can always add or remove `entr_` to
run a block one time or multiple times.

In the background, `gen` passes the methods through
`convert_output(expr::String, path, out::T)` where `T` can, for example,
be a DataFrame or a plot. To show that a DataFrame is converted to a
Markdown table, we define a method

```language-julia
my_table() = DataFrame(U = [1, 2], V = [:a, :b], W = [3, 4])
```

and add its output to the Markdown file with

````
```jl
BooksDocs.my_table()
```
````

Then, it will show as

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([U], [V], [W],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [a], [3],
    [2], [b], [4],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 2: My table.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:my_table>
where the caption and the label are inferred from the `path`. Refer to
Table~#link(<tbl:my_table>)[2] with

```language-markdown
@tbl:my_table
```

To show multiple objects, pass a `Vector`:

```language-julia
function multiple_df_vector()
    [DataFrame(Z = [3]), DataFrame(U = [4, 5], V = [6, 7])]
end
BooksDocs.multiple_df_vector()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 1,
    align: (right,),
    table.header([Z],),
    table.hline(),
    [3],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([U], [V],),
    table.hline(),
    [4], [6],
    [5], [7],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

When you want to control where the various objects are saved, use
`Options`. This way, you can pass a informative path with plots for
which informative captions, cross-reference labels and image names can
be determined.

```language-julia
function multiple_df_example()
    objects = [
        DataFrame(X = [3, 4], Y = [5, 6]),
        DataFrame(U = [7, 8], V = [9, 10])
    ]
    filenames = ["a", "b"]
    Options.(objects, filenames)
end
BooksDocs.multiple_df_example()
```

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([X], [Y],),
    table.hline(),
    [3], [5],
    [4], [6],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 3: A.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:a>
#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([U], [V],),
    table.hline(),
    [7], [9],
    [8], [10],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 4: B.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:b>
To define the labels and/or captions manually, see
Section~#link(<sec:labels-captions>)[3.2];. For showing multiple plots,
see Section~#link(<sec:plots>)[3.4];.

Most things can be done via functions. However, defining a struct is not
possible, because `@sco` cannot locate the struct definition inside the
module. Therefore, it is also possible to pass code and specify that you
want to evaluate and show code (sc) without showing the output:

````
```jl
s = """
    struct Point
        x
        y
    end
    """
sc(s)
```
````

which shows as

```language-julia
struct Point
    x
    y
end
```

and show code and output (sco). For example,

````
```jl
sco("p = Point(1, 2)")
```
````

shows as

```language-julia
p = Point(1, 2)
```

```output
Point(1, 2)
```

Note that this is starting to look a lot like R Markdown where the
syntax would be something like

````
```{r, results='hide'}
x = rnorm(100)
```
````

I guess that there is no perfect way here. The benefit of evaluating the
user input directly, as Books.jl is doing, seems to be that it is more
extensible if I’m not mistaken. Possibly, the reasoning is that R
Markdown needs to convert the output directly, whereas Julia’s better
type system allows for converting in much later stages, but I’m not
sure.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[Tip];: When using `sco`, the code is evaluated in the `Main`
module. This means that the objects, such as the `Point` struct defined
above, are available in your REPL after running `gen()`.
]

== Labels and captions
<sec:labels-captions>
To set labels and captions, wrap your object in `Options`:

```language-julia
function options_example()
    df = DataFrame(A=[1], B=[2], C=[3])
    caption = "My DataFrame."
    label = "foo"
    return Options(df; caption, label)
end
BooksDocs.options_example()
```

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([A], [B], [C],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [2], [3],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 5: My DataFrame.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:foo>
which can be referred to with

```
@tbl:foo
```

#quote(block: true)[
Table~#link(<tbl:foo>)[5]
]

It is also possible to pass only a caption or a label. This package will
attempt to infer missing information from the `path`, `caption` or
`label` when possible:

```output
julia> Books.caption_label("foo_bar()", missing, missing)
(caption = "Foo bar.", label = "foo_bar")

julia> Books.caption_label("foo_bar()", "My caption.", missing)
(caption = "My caption.", label = "foo_bar")

julia> Books.caption_label("foo_bar()", "My caption.", nothing)
(caption = "My caption.", label = nothing)

julia> Books.caption_label(missing, "My caption.", missing)
(caption = "My caption.", label = nothing)

julia> Books.caption_label(missing, missing, "my_label")
(caption = "My label.", label = "my_label")

julia> Books.caption_label(missing, missing, missing)
(caption = nothing, label = nothing)
```

== Obtaining function definitions
<sec:function_code_blocks>
So, instead of passing a string which `Books.jl` will evaluate,
`Books.jl` can also obtain the code for a method directly. (Thanks to
`CodeTracking.@code_string`.) For example, inside our package, we can
define the following method:

```language-julia
function my_data()
    DataFrame(A = [1, 2], B = [3, 4], C = [5, 6], D = [7, 8])
end
```

To show code and output (sco) for this method, use the `@sco` macro.
This macro is exported by Books, so ensure that you have `using Books`
in your package.

````
```jl
@sco BooksDocs.my_data()
```
````

This gives

```language-julia
function my_data()
    DataFrame(A = [1, 2], B = [3, 4], C = [5, 6], D = [7, 8])
end
BooksDocs.my_data()
```

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 4,
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([A], [B], [C], [D],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [3], [5], [7],
    [2], [4], [6], [8],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 6: My data.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:my_data>
To only show the source code, use `@sc`:

````
```jl
@sc BooksDocs.my_data()
```
````

resulting in

```language-julia
function my_data()
    DataFrame(A = [1, 2], B = [3, 4], C = [5, 6], D = [7, 8])
end
```

To override options for your output, use the `pre` keyword argument of
`@sco`:

````
```jl
let
    caption = "This caption is set via the pre keyword."
    pre(out) = Options(out; caption)
    @sco pre=pre my_data()
end
```
````

which appears to the reader as:

```language-julia
function my_data()
    DataFrame(A = [1, 2], B = [3, 4], C = [5, 6], D = [7, 8])
end
my_data()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 4,
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([A], [B], [C], [D],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [3], [5], [7],
    [2], [4], [6], [8],
  )]
  , caption: [This caption is set via the pre keyword.]
  , kind: table
  )

See `?sco` for more information. Since we’re using methods as code
blocks, we can use the code shown in one code block in another. For
example, to determine the mean of column A:

````
```jl
@sco BooksDocs.my_data_mean(my_data())
```
````

shows as

```language-julia
function my_data_mean(df::DataFrame)
    Statistics.mean(df.A)
end
BooksDocs.my_data_mean(my_data())
```

1.5

Or, we can show the output inline, namely 1.5, by using

```
`jl BooksDocs.my_data_mean(my_data())`
```

It is also possible to show methods with parameters. For example,

````
```jl
@sc BooksDocs.hello("" )
```
````

shows

```language-julia
hello(name) = "Hello, $name"
```

Now, we can show

```language-julia
BooksDocs.hello("World")
```

```output

Hello, World
```

Here, the `M` can be a bit confusing for readers. If this is a problem,
you can export the method `hello` to avoid it. If you are really sure,
you can export all symbols in your module with something like
#link("https://discourse.julialang.org/t/exportall/4970/16")[this];.

== Plots
<sec:plots>
For image types from libraries that `Books.jl` doesn’t know about such
as plotting types from `Plots.jl` and `Makie.jl`, it is required to
extend two methods. First of all, extend `Books.is_image` so that it
returns true for the figure type of the respective plotting library. For
example for `Plots.jl` set

```julia
import Books

Books.is_image(plot::Plots.Plot) = true
```

and extend `Books.svg` and `Books.png` too. For example, for `Plots.jl`:

```language-julia
Books.svg(svg_path::String, p::Plot) = savefig(p, svg_path)
```

Adding plots to books is actually a bit tricky, because we want to show
vector graphics (SVG) on the web, but these are not supported (well) by
LaTeX. Therefore, portable network graphics (PNG) images are also
created and passed to LaTeX, so set `Books.png` too:

```language-julia
Books.png(png_path::String, p::Plot) = savefig(p, png_path)
```

Then, plotting works:

```language-julia
function example_plot()
    I = 1:30
    plot(I, I.^2)
end
BooksDocs.example_plot()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/BooksDocs_example_plot_.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 2: Example plot.
  ]
)
<fig:example_plot>

For multiple images, use `Options.(objects, paths)`:

```language-julia
function multiple_example_plots()
    filenames = ["example_plot_$i" for i in 2:3]
    I = 1:30
    objects = [
        plot(I, I.^2),
        scatter(I, I.^3)
    ]
    return Options.(objects, filenames)
end
```

Resulting in one `Plots.jl` (Figure~#link(<fig:example_plot_2>)[3];) and
one `CairoMakie.jl` (Figure~#link(<fig:example_plot_3>)[4];) plot:

#figure(image("_build/im/example_plot_2.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 3: Example plot 2.
  ]
)
<fig:example_plot_2>

#figure(image("_build/im/example_plot_3.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 4: Example plot 3.
  ]
)
<fig:example_plot_3>

To change the size, change the resolution of the image:

```language-julia
function image_options_plot()
    I = 1:30
    fig = Figure(; size=(600, 140))
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1]; xlabel="x", ylabel="y")
    scatterlines!(ax, I, 3 .* sin.(I))
    return fig
end
BooksDocs.image_options_plot()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/BooksDocs_image_options_plot_.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 5: Image options plot.
  ]
)
<fig:image_options_plot>

And, for adjusting the caption, use `Options`:

```language-julia
function combined_options_plot()
    fg = image_options_plot()
    Options(fg; caption="Sine function.")
end
BooksDocs.combined_options_plot()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/BooksDocs_combined_options_plot_.png"),
  caption: [
    Sine function.
  ]
)

or the caption can be specified in the Markdown file:

````
```jl
p = BooksDocs.image_options_plot()
Options(p; caption="Label specified in Markdown.")
```
````

#figure(image("_build/im/p_BooksDocs_image_options_plot_Options_p_caption_Label_specified_in_Markdo.png"),
  caption: [
    Label specified in Markdown.
  ]
)

\

```language-julia
function plotsjl()
    p = plot(1:10, 1:2:20)
    caption = "An example plot with Plots.jl."
    # Label defaults to `nothing`, which will not create a cross-reference.
    label = missing
    Options(p; caption, label)
end
BooksDocs.plotsjl()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/BooksDocs_plotsjl_.png"),
  caption: [
    An example plot with Plots.jl.
  ]
)

This time, we also pass `link_attributes` to Pandoc
(Figure~#link(<fig:makie>)[6];) to shrink the image width on the page:

```language-julia
function makiejl()
    x = range(0, 10, length=100)
    y = sin.(x)
    p = lines(x, y)
    caption = "An example plot with Makie.jl."
    label = "makie"
    link_attributes = "width=70%"
    Options(p; caption, label, link_attributes)
end
BooksDocs.makiejl()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/BooksDocs_makiejl_.png", width: 70%),
  caption: [
    Figure 6: An example plot with Makie.jl.
  ]
)
<fig:makie>

== Other notes
<other-notes>
=== Multilingual books
<multilingual-books>
For an example of a multilingual book setup, say English and Chinese,
see #link("https://juliadatascience.io");.

=== Footnotes
<footnotes>
Footnotes can be added via regular Markdown syntax:

```
Some sentence[^foot].

[^foot]: Footnote text.
```

#quote(block: true)[
Some sentence#footnote[Footnote text.];.
]

=== Show
<show>
When your method returns an output type `T` which is unknown to
Books.jl, it will be passed through
`show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", object::T)`. So, if the package that
you’re using has defined a new `show` method, this will be used. For
example, for a grouped DataFrame:

```language-julia
groupby(DataFrame(; A=[1]), :A)
```

```output
GroupedDataFrame with 1 group based on key: A
Group 1 (1 row): A = 1
 Row │ A
     │ Int64
─────┼───────
   1 │     1
```

=== Note box
<note-box>
To write note boxes, you can use

```
> **_NOTE:_**  The note content.
```

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] The note content.
]

This way is fully supported by Pandoc, so it will be correctly converted
to outputs such as PDF.

=== Advanced `sco` options
<advanced-sco-options>
To enforce output to be embedded inside a code block, use `scob`. For
example,

```language-julia
scob("
df = DataFrame(A = [1], B = [Date(2018)])
string(df)
")
```

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(A = [1], B = [Date(2018)])
string(df)
```

```output

1×2 DataFrame
 Row │ A      B
     │ Int64  Date
─────┼───────────────────
   1 │     1  2018-01-01
```

or, with a string

```language-julia
s = "Hello"
```

```output

Hello
```

Another way to change the output is via the keyword arguments `pre`,
`process` and `post` for `sco`. The idea of these arguments is that they
allow you to pass a function to alter the processing that Books.jl does.
`pre` is applied #strong[before] `Books.convert_output`, `process` is
applied #strong[instead] of `Books.convert_output` and `post` is applied
#strong[after] `Books.convert_output`. For example, to force books to
convert a DataFrame to a string instead of a Markdown table, use:

````
```jl
s = "df = DataFrame(A = [1], B = [Date(2018)])"
sco(s; process=string, post=output_block)
```
````

which shows the following to the reader:

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(A = [1], B = [Date(2018)])
```

```output
1×2 DataFrame
 Row │ A      B
     │ Int64  Date
─────┼───────────────────
   1 │     1  2018-01-01
```

Without `process=string`, the output would automatically be converted to
a Markdown table by Books.jl and then wrapped inside a code block, which
will cause Pandoc to show the raw output instead of a table.

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(A = [1], B = [Date(2018)])
```

```output
|   A |          B |
| ---:| ----------:|
|   1 | 2018-01-01 |
```

Without `post=output_block`, the DataFrame would be converted to a
string, but not wrapped inside a code block so that Pandoc will treat is
as normal Markdown:

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(A = [2], B = [Date(2018)])
```

Options(1×2 DataFrame Row │ A B │ Int64 Date ─────┼─────────────────── 1
│ 2 2018-01-01, missing, nothing, nothing, missing)

This also works for `@sco`. For example, for `my_data` we can use:

````
```jl
@sco process=string post=output_block my_data()
```
````

which will show as:

```language-julia
function my_data()
    DataFrame(A = [1, 2], B = [3, 4], C = [5, 6], D = [7, 8])
end
my_data()
```

```output
2×4 DataFrame
 Row │ A      B      C      D
     │ Int64  Int64  Int64  Int64
─────┼────────────────────────────
   1 │     1      3      5      7
   2 │     2      4      6      8
```

=== Fonts
<fonts>
The code blocks default to JuliaMono in HTML and PDF. For the HTML, this
package automatically handles JuliaMono. However, for the PDF, this just
doesn’t work out (see, e.g.,
#link("https://github.com/JuliaBooks/Books.jl/pull/257")[PR \#257];). To
get JuliaMono to work with the PDF build, install it globally. See the
instructions at the
#link("https://juliamono.netlify.app/download/#installation")[JuliaMono site];.
On Linux, you can use `Books.install_extra_fonts()`, but beware that it
might override user settings.

Ligatures from JuliaMono are disabled. For example, none of these
symbols are combined into a single glyph.

```
|> => and <=
```

=== Long lines in code blocks
<long-lines-in-code-blocks>
```language-plain
When code or output is getting too long, a horizontal scrollbar is visible on the website to scroll horizontally and a red arrow is visible in the PDF.
```

=== Code blocks in lists
<code-blocks-in-lists>
To embed code blocks inside lists, indent by 3 spaces and place an empty
line before and after the code block. For example, this will show as:

+ This is a list item with some code and output:

  ```language-julia
  x = 2 + 1
  ```

  ```output

  3
  ```

+ And the list continues

  - with an example on the third level:

    ```language-julia
    x = 3 + 1
    ```

    ```output

    4
    ```

  - another third level item

  - and another
