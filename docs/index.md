# Welcome

[//]: # (This file is only included on the website.)

This book introduces and demonstrates `Books.jl`.

Basically, this package is a wrapper around [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
Creating EPUBs and PDFs with Pandoc is easy.
However, this package allows 

- building a website spanning multiple pages
- live reloading the website to see changes quickly; thanks to [LiveServer.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/LiveServer.jl)
- references from one html page to a section on another page
