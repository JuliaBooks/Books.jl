# Welcome {-}

This website introduces and demonstrates `Books.jl`, and is also available as [PDF](/book.pdf).

Basically, this package is a wrapper around [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/); similar to [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org).
Creating EPUBs and PDFs with Pandoc is easy.
For html, this package allows 

- building a website spanning multiple pages
- live reloading the website to see changes quickly; thanks to [LiveServer.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/LiveServer.jl)
- references from one html page to a section on another page

If you don't need PDFs or EPUBs, then [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) is a much better choice.
To create single pages and PDFs containing code blocks, see [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl).
